# ArcScrape
Small API for scraping ArcGIS data from online MapServers.

## Example
Suppose we wanted to collect demographic data from the 2000 Census data located [here](https://sampleserver1.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Demographics/ESRI_Census_USA/MapServer).  

After exploring the server, we decide that [layer 4](https://sampleserver1.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Demographics/ESRI_Census_USA/MapServer/4) has the population statistics we are interested in.
